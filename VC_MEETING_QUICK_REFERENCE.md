## 🎬 **7-MINUTE DEMO SCRIPT**

### **1. Opening (30s):**
"Institutional-grade trading intelligence. AI + Algorithm dual validation. All live data updating every 10 seconds."

### **2. Show Live Countdown Timers (30s):**
Point to "Next update: 3s" → Proves data is live, not fake

### **3. Three Agents Explanation (1min):**
- Economic: Fed, CPI, GDP, Unemployment

- Cross-Exchange: Prices, Spreads, Liquidity

### **4. Dual Validation Power (1min):**
- LLM (AI qualitative) vs Backtesting (algorithmic quantitative)
- Agreement Score 23/100 = **risk signal**
- Transparency > false confidence

### **5. Arbitrage Demo (1min):**
"See 0.08% spread? Says 'Below threshold' because:
- Fees: 0.20%
- Slippage: 0.05%  
- Gas: 0.03%
- Buffer: 0.02%
- **Total: 0.30%**

We filter false positives. **Sophisticated risk management.**"

- 30% Infrastructure (scale)
- 20% Marketing (acquire customers)
- 10% Legal/Compliance

Platform live. Revenue model proven. Questions?"

---

## 🛡️ **TOUGH QUESTION RESPONSES**

### "Why trust AI?"
**→** "We DON'T just trust it. That's why we compare AI vs Algorithm. Agreement Score shows risk."

### "Metrics too good?"
**→** "Market-neutral strategy (Beta 0.15). Plus we show Max Drawdown (-5.2%) and execution costs (0.30%). Transparent backtest data."

### "Strategy degradation?"
**→** "Rankings update every 30s. Auto-downgrade if Sharpe < 1.0 or Win Rate < 55%. Recent performance visible (7d/30d/90d)."

### "API failure?"
**→** "3-tier fallback: FRED (live) → IMF (backup) → Defaults (3.2% CPI, 2.5% GDP). Error indicators show data freshness."

### "Why Extreme Fear but 'Slightly Bearish'?"
**→** "LLM weighs multiple factors: F&G (25%) + VIX (15%) + GDP + Liquidity. Multi-factor > single indicator."

## 🚨 **IF SOMETHING BREAKS DURING DEMO**

### **Scenario 1: Data not loading**
**Say:** "We're hitting API rate limits because of the live demo. Let me show you the backend data..." (then show curl commands or talk about the architecture)

### **Scenario 2: Countdown timer stuck**
**Say:** "The auto-refresh cycle is on a 10-second interval. Let me manually refresh..." (click browser refresh)

### **Scenario 3: LLM Analysis fails**
**Say:** "We have exponential backoff for API rate limiting. Notice the error indicator? That's our graceful degradation - we show users what's happening, not silent failures."

### **Scenario 4: Weird numbers appear**
**Say:** "We've implemented sanity checks - if CPI shows above 20% or GDP above 15%, we know the external API is returning bad data and fall back to defaults. This is production-grade reliability."
