## ðŸŽ¤ Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

*"We've built an AI-driven trading intelligence platform that combines live market data from 5+ sources with constraint-based agent filtering and Google Gemini AI analysis. Unlike existing platforms that show raw data or use black-box algorithms, we provide transparent, rule-based validation across economic, sentiment, and liquidity dimensions. Our fair comparison framework evaluates both AI and algorithmic strategies using identical data sources. We're production-ready, cost-efficient at $5-10/month to operate, and positioned to capture the $21.5B algorithmic trading market. We're seeking $500K seed funding to scale to multi-asset support and acquire our first 10,000 users."*
