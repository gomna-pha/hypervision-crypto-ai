## ✅ Verification Checklist

### Payment Systems:
- [ ] Can you see the Payment Systems tab?
- [ ] Does it show payment gateway options?
- [ ] Are the metrics updating (Daily Volume, Success Rate)?
- [ ] Can you see the live transaction feed at the bottom?
- [ ] Are DeFi protocols listed (Uniswap, Aave, etc.)?

### ML Pipeline:
- [ ] Can you see Model Transparency tab?
- [ ] Is the Machine Learning Pipeline section visible?
- [ ] Does it show exactly the three columns as listed above?
- [ ] Are the model weights correct (40%, 30%, 20%, 10%)?
- [ ] Can you see the hyperbolic formulas with MathJax rendering?

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

If tabs are not visible:
1. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Check browser console** (F12) for any errors
3. **Try a different browser** (Chrome/Firefox/Safari)
4. **Clear cache and cookies**

If Payment Systems tab is missing:
- The tab should be the 6th button in the navigation
- Look for the credit card icon
- It's after "Model Transparency" tab

If ML Pipeline is not showing correctly:
- Go to Model Transparency tab
- Scroll down past the architecture section
- Look for "Machine Learning Pipeline" heading
- Should show 3 columns with exact features listed
