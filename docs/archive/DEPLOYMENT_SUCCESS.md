# 🎉 DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL!

## ✅ The GitHub Pages has been FIXED!

The old React app has been completely replaced with your Gomna AI platform.

**What was done:**
1. Discovered GitHub Pages was serving from `gh-pages` branch (not `main`)

3. Completely replaced it with the Gomna AI production platform
4. Force pushed the correct version
